They're just silly.

174
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,855
They're just silly, stupid boys.

175
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,398
I'm gonna start dating men.

176
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,943
Uh, I'm sorry, Judy.

177
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,780
I couldn't find that bowl
you and Jack were looking for.

178
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,619
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.

179
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,830
Monica.

180
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,545
Hey, Chandler?

181
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,217
Did you like
the macaroni and cheese?

182
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,428
Oh, yeah. It was great.
You should be a chef.

183
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,764
Okay.

184
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,935
Guess what.

185
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,314
All this stuff about Nancy Branson
being a slut was all a rumor.

186
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,859
Chip dumped her, and he wants
to come over to my house tonight.

187
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,403
- Oh, that is so great.
RACHEL: I know.

188
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,406
Oh, gosh. Listen,
if you and Chip do it tonight...

189
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,368
...um, promise me
you'll tell me everything?

190
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:05,413
Oh, totally, totally. It's not that big a deal.
We already kind of did it once, you know.

191
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,917
I know, but this time you're gonna
definitely know whether or not you did it.

192
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,335
I know.

193
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:15,590
Oh, and Chip promised that this time
it would last at least for an entire song.

194
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,512
So I'm thinking of asking
Rachel out tonight.

195
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,223
You know, maybe playing her that song
we wrote last week.

196
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,059
- "Emotional Knapsack"? Right on.
- Right on.

197
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,606
Oh, uh, but don't take long, okay?
Because we're testing our fake ID's tonight.

198
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,775
Right, Clifford Alvarez?

199
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,488
Listen, Roland Cheng...

200
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,325
...if things go well,
I may be out with her all night.

201
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,786
Dude, don't do that to me.

202
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,497
Oh, no. It's cool, you can stay here.
My parents won't mind.

203
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,709
It's not that. I don't wanna be stuck here
all night with your fat sister.

204
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,168
Hey.

205
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,549
Monica, why don't you finish off
these pies?

206
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,135
I don't have any more room in the fridge.

207
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,596
No.

208
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,182
No, thank you.

209
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,767
Well, Judy, you did it.

210
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,478
She's finally full.

211
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,067
I called you fat?

212
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,611
- I don't even remember that.
- Well, I do.

213
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,615
I'm so sorry. I really am.
But, come on, I was an idiot back then.

214
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,535
I rushed the stage at a Wham! Concert,
for crying out loud.

215
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,664
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.

216
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,084
I can't believe you let
George Michael slap you.

217
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,879
I am really sorry.

218
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,340
That is so terrible. I'm so, so sorry.

219
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,260
Actually, that's not the Thanksgiving
I was talking about.

220
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,138
- Yes, it was.
- No, it wasn't. It was actually...

221
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,056
Thanksgiving's over.
Get ready for Christmas.

222
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,558
Who wants to get a Christmas tree?

223
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,146
Oh, no. I have the cutest Christmas story.

224
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,190
We wanna hear Monica's
Thanksgiving story.

225
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,942
Fine, all right. Mine had a dwarf
that got broke in half.

226
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,069
But, you know, whatever.

227
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,449
So, Rachel, your mom tells me
you changed your major again?

228
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,950
Oh, yeah, I had to.

229
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,245
There was never any parking
by the Psychology building.

230
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,581
- Hi, Rachel.
- Oh, hi.

231
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,667
- Wow. Love your new nose.
- Jack.

232
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,420
What? Dr. Wolfson's an artist.

233
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,005
He removed my mole cluster.

234
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,590
Want to see?

235
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,925
[DOORBELL RINGS]

236
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,010
No, God. Please, let me.

237
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,808
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,104
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi.

239
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,607
God, your hair sure is different.

240
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,526
Yeah, we were just talking about that.

241
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,445
Can't we can't believe
how stupid we used to look.

242
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,283
So, uh, where's Monica?

243
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,285
She's upstairs. Monica.

244
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,204
Come down, everyone's here.

245
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:55,208
Ross, Rachel and the boy
who hates Thanksgiving.

246
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,921
Hi, Chandler.

247
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,131
Oh, my God.

248
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,592
What's the matter?

249
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,220
Is there something on my dress?

250
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,933
You just... You look so different. Terrific.

251
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,685
That dress, that body...

252
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,186
- Dude.
- Sorry.

253
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,148
Yes, yes, Monica is thin. It's wonderful.

254
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,652
But what we really want to hear about
is Ross' new girlfriend.

255
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,196
Oh, Mom... Okay.

256
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,490
Um, ahem, her name is Carol...

257
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,701
...and she's really pretty and smart.

258
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,204
And, uh, she's on the lacrosse team
and the golf team.

259
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,914
Can you believe it?

260
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,000
She plays for both teams.

261
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,714
So, Chandler,
I guess I'll see you at dinner.

262
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,050
- Dude.
- Sorry.

263
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,553
Oh, my God.

264
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,305
That was so awesome.

265
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,599
You totally got him back
for calling you fat.

266
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,517
He was just drooling all over you.

267
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,312
- That must have felt so great.
- Well, it didn't.

268
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,063
What?

269
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,357
Yeah, I mean, I look great.

270
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,235
And yeah, I feel great, and, yeah,
my heart's not in trouble anymore.

271
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,029
Blah, blah, blah.

272
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,907
I just don't feel like I got him back,
you know?

273
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,242
I mean, I just want to humiliate him.

274
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,119
I want him to be, like, naked...

275
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,039
...and I want to point at him
and I wanna laugh.

276
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,627
Okay. That, we may be able to do.

277
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,754
How?

278
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,716
Well, guys tend to get naked
before they're gonna have sex.

279
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,428
What? I mean, I didn't work this hard
and lose all this weight...

280
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,057
...just so I could give my flower
to someone like him.

281
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,269
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that,
no one is ever gonna take it.

282
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,106
And then second of all, you're not gonna
actually have sex with him.

283
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,525
You're just gonna make him think
that you are.

284
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

285
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,030
And then when he's naked...

286
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,032
...I can throw him out, lock the door...

287
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,743
...and all our neighbors
will just humiliate him.

288
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,329
And then you will definitely
get him back.

289
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,665
Okay, so how do I make him think
I want to have sex?

290
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,917
Uh, Oh! Here's what you do.

291
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:05,546
Just act like everything around you
turns you on.

292
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,802
- What do you mean?
- Well, like, anything can be sexy.

293
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,681
Like, um... Oh, okay. Like this dish towel.

294
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,850
Ooh, ooh.

295
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,729
This feels so good against my cheek.

296
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,608
And if I get a little hot,
I can just dab myself with it.

297
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,113
Or I can bring it down to my side
and maybe run it through my fingers...

298
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,781
...while I talk to him.

299
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,909
- I can do that.
- Okay, good, good, good.

300
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,744
Get busy. He's coming. He's coming.

301
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,706
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

302
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,460
I was wondering if you could make me
some mac and cheese...

303
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,087
...like last year?

304
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,923
I'd love to.

305
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,388
Ooh.

306
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,099
I love macaroni and cheese.

307
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,896
I love the way this box feels
against my cheek.

308
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,530
- Okay.
- Ooh, and I love carrots.

309
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,948
Oh!

310
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,579
Sometimes I like to put them
between my fingers.

311
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,915
Like this.

312
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,002
And hold them down here
while I talk to you.

313
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,259
Um, and, you know, if I get really hot...

314
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,138
...um, I like to pick up this knife.

315
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:42,769
And, um, I put the cool steel...

316
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,604
...against, um...

317
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,023
...my body.

318
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,902
Are you all right?

319
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,279
I'm fine.

320
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,712
- What do got?
- Twenty-year-old male.

321
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,090
He's got a severed toe on his right foot.

322
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,508
Ow!

323
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,844
Could you please not do that feet first?

324
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,389
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!

325
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,393
It says here the knife
went right through your shoe.

326
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,979
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.

327
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,273
- Did you bring the toe?
- Oh, yes.

328
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,609
I have it right here on ice.

329
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,655
Don't worry, son.
We'll just reattach it and then...

330
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,908
- What is it?
- You brought a carrot.

331
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,620
- What?
- This isn't your toe.

332
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,040
This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.

333
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,376
You brought a carrot?

334
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,336
Oh, my God.

335
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,588
There's a toe in my kitchen.

336
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,300
God, I'm sorry. I'll go back and get it.

337
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,469
It's too late.
All we can do is sew up the wound.

338
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,930
- Without my toe? I need my toe.
MONICA: Okay.

339
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,433
No, no, no. I can go really fast.
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.

340
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,978
Oh, I'm not falling for that one.

341
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,524
That's why I lost my toe?
