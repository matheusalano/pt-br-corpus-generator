1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:08,924
Hi. Yeah, hi. I'm, um, Phoebe Buffay
and I have babies coming out.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,635
Okay.
Have you started having contractions?

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,638
Not yet. Um, I heard they really hurt.
Do they?

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,433
- Well...
- Oh, my God.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,102
Which of you is the father?

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,313
None of them are.
The father is my brother.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,524
Okay.

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,403
I'll miss watching you
freak people out like that.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,988
JOEY:
Pheebs...

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,824
This is for the babies
to look at someday.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,660
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,120
Okay. Um...

14
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,707
Hi, kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,127
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me.

16
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,298
What took you so long?

17
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,717
Your cab left when ours did.

18
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,223
We went back because
I forgot my jacket.

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,688
You're not wearing one.

20
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,067
Oh, man! I did it again!

21
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,737
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.

22
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,156
My mom might...
What are you doing?

23
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,533
I've got to get the before shot.

24
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,340
We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...

25
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,592
...is because, uh, she's not coming.

26
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,804
- What?
- She hit her head in the shower.

27
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,432
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

28
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,768
Pheebs, it's going to be okay.

29
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,772
I don't see three kids
coming out of your vagina.

30
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,404
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.

31
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,489
He's head of the department.

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,325
All right. Ooh. Oh, dear God, save me.

33
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,661
I'm having my first contraction.

34
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,955
- Oh, it's not bad.
CHANDLER: Okay.

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,502
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And I...

36
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,712
[YELLS]

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,921
You okay?

38
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,257
Something hurts.

39
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,343
Ooh, it's sympathy pains.
Oh, that's so sweet.

40
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,888
I didn't know I cared that much.

41
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,892
- Hello.
- Hi.

42
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,770
I'm Dr. Harad.
I'll be delivering your babies.

43
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,357
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.

44
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,985
I'll be back to do your internal.

45
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,404
Just relax, everything looks great.

46
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,199
And also, I love Fonzie.

47
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,079
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

48
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,123
That's what it sounded like.

49
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,000
All right.

50
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,378
ALL:
Hey!

51
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,382
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?

52
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,385
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?

53
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,972
Uh, Delaware. Until she gets here,
I'll be your coach.

54
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,184
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.

55
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,646
If you get the babies out
by month's end...

56
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,731
...you get two percent financing.

57
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,441
Yeah.

58
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,572
Monica, you're going to be
very proud of me.

59
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,409
I just got us dates with two
unbelievably cute nurses.

60
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,953
Oh, my.

61
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,206
They're male nurses.

62
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,291
Heh, heh. Not in my head.

63
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,671
They want to take us out Saturday night.
What do you say?

64
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,715
Um...

65
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,387
- I don't think so.
- What?

66
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,097
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,059
You've been telling me to
get over Ross and move on.

68
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,395
I'm moving on and so are you.

69
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,105
Why don't you want to go?

70
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,399
Um...

71
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,151
Why don't you give me
a good reason...

72
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,696
...and I'll tell you if it's true.

73
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,284
- What?
- Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

74
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,453
You're coming.
And when they get off...

75
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,039
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

76
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,751
Yep. There's always room for Jello.

77
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,132
How do you make that dirty?

78
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,968
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.

79
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,763
Grandma's chicken salad...

80
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,605
Ross!

81
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,025
Get a shot of this.

82
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,570
Hey, babies, these are the headlines
when you were born.

83
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,532
Now girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies...

84
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,409
...check it out.

85
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,871
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.

86
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,665
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

87
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,669
Okay, I'm having another one.

88
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,756
This one doesn't hurt eith...
Ooh, yes, it does! Ow.

89
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,050
Ow, ow, ow!

90
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,385
Ooh.

91
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,555
Ooh, I was kind of hoping that was it.

92
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,518
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

93
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,730
A couple of nurses asked them out.
Maybe they're with them.

94
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,357
Really? Male nurses?

95
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,567
Yeah, I was bummed too.

96
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,737
So they're going on dates?

97
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,572
- When?
- I think Saturday.

98
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,282
[YELLS]

99
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,786
- What's with him?
- Um, sympathy pains.

100
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:15,582
It was sweet at first, but now I think
he's trying to steal my thunder.

101
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,043
Okay.

102
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,087
Let's see what we got here.

103
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,924
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

104
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,428
This Fonzie person you
keep referring to...

105
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,722
...is that another doctor?

106
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,973
Oh, no, no.

107
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,976
Fonzie is the nickname of
Arthur Fonzerelli.

108
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,437
The Fonz.

109
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,191
All right.

110
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,943
Soon.

111
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,489
It's not that weird, is it?

112
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,449
It's very weird.

113
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:54,371
I don't want some guy down there
telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."

114
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,584
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie...

115
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,961
What are you doing?

116
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,674
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...

117
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,926
...who isn't crazy
and doesn't Fonzie!

118
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,679
- Again, it's not...
- Aah! Aah!

119
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,854
Hey, there you are.

120
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,523
Um, there's something you should know.

121
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,734
Is this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.

122
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,613
I am so fine.
You and I, we're just, nothing.

123
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,283
Just goofing around.

124
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,998
Um, I was about to tell you
I was getting out of it.

125
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,085
But, um, if we're just "goofing around,"
maybe I will go out with him.

126
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,379
Fine. Maybe I will too.

127
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,468
Hey! Look what I found
in the gift shop...

128
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,971
Oh. Get up! Get up! Get up!

129
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,186
Okay, Pheebs?

130
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,104
This is Dr. Oberman.

131
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,232
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...

132
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,569
...or any of the Happy Days gang.

133
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,655
You're going into what grade?

134
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,410
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.

135
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,786
Uh-huh. Me too.

136
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:21,583
Ross, I should have specified
I'd need a grown-up doctor.

137
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,044
Really, I'm fully qualified...

138
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,295
Shh, Doogie. Shh.

139
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,177
Doesn't anybody understand that
I'm going to be having babies soon? Huh?

140
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,804
Go, little boy! Go!

141
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,019
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

142
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:50,320
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.

143
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,906
Uh, well, what else could it be?

144
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,116
It's kidney stones.

145
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,118
Or...

146
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,912
Kidney stones.

147
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,793
You're getting there.

148
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,254
These babies are very, very lucky.

149
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,505
They are? Why?

150
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,841
They'll be born
on the Fonz's half-birthday.

151
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,971
Happy birthday.

152
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,473
Just to clarify.

153
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,350
I'm not Fonzie.

154
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,646
Yeah.

155
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,488
It's a terrific thing that you're having
these babies for Frank and Alice.

156
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,365
- I know, it is.
- Yeah.

157
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,076
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

158
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,996
I want to keep one.

159
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,877
Oh, I'm going to be on the news.

160
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,882
You've gotta be kidding.

161
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,719
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.

162
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,929
Maybe I can. You don't know.

163
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,183
I do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.

164
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,811
Maybe not. You know?

165
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,355
Three babies are a handful.

166
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,816
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

167
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,572
I hate to miss an opportunity
because I didn't ask.

168
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,951
Phoebe, no. This is insane.

169
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,286
Just ask him.

170
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,204
What? Me?

171
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,414
I can't ask him!

172
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,959
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?

173
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,796
All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank.

174
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,298
Just feel him out.

175
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,135
No. I will not ask Frank
to give you one of his kids.
