Here we go, here we go.

350
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,349
JOEY & CHANDLER: Hey.
- Hey.

351
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:31,229
So I, uh, didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.

352
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,605
You're kidding?

353
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:36,984
But Phoebe said I could stay
at her place for a while, so...

354
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,696
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.

355
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,699
You don't need me
taking up all your space.

356
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,412
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.

357
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,123
Please, just stay.

358
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,667
Yeah.

359
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,960
Are you sure?

360
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,255
- Definitely.
- You have to stay.

361
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,634
- All right.
- All right, buddy.

362
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,762
So I'm a pimp, huh?

363
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,267
It's okay.

364
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,769
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.

365
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,690
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.

366
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:22,238
And I'll do everything I can
to keep my annoying habits just...

367
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,798
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

368
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,259
The cowboy hat's a little much.

369
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,469
Come on, it's fun!

370
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,557
All right.

371
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,274
Isn't this a woman's hat?

372
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,528
Dude, stop talking crazy,
and make us some tea!
